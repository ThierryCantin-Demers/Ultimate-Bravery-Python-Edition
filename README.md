# Ultimate-Bravery-Python-Edition

This is a project that I worked on in 2017 before having formal education in programming.
It is another way to play the game League of Legends where the program decides how you play it.

It's my recreation in python of the original website version of this program: https://www.ultimate-bravery.net/
